# Bounce
Infinity run 3D game similiar to subway surfers. Developed using Unity3D and assets from OpenGameArt.org

# How to play

Use the on-screen buttons to move the ball, try to avoid hitting the transparent cubes but try to hit the capsules. Every time you hit a capsule you score. As your score increases, the game speed increases also, making the game harder. If you collide with a cube it is game over.
